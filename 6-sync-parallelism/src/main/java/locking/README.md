[Reentrant MutEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reentrant_mutex)/ `Recursive MutEx`
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
Reentrant mutex (Recursive MutEx, Recursive lock) is particular type of MUTual EXclusion (mutex)
device that may be locked multiple times by the same process/thread, 
without causing a deadlock.

----------------------

1. `MutEx`
--------

```
A MutEx is a MUTual EXclusion semaphore, a special variant of a semaphore that only allows
one locker at a time and whose ownership restrictions may be more stringent than a normal semaphore.

In other words, it's equivalent to a normal counting semaphore with a count of one and the requirement
that it can only be released by the same thread that locked it.
```

```
eg.

Imagine that there are some albums to sell (item inventory).
When any people buy the albums at the same time: each person is a thread to buy albums.

Obviously we need to use the MutEx to protect the albums because it is the shared resource.
```

- eg. concert where only one artist can perform at a time. (so an artist locks the stage) 
others have to wait until first artist is done.

[JVM Lock Objects](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/newlocks.html)

```
Lock objects work very much like the implicit locks used by synchronized code. 
As with implicit locks, only one thread can own a Lock object at a time.
```

[JVM ReentrantLock](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html)

```
A reentrant Mutual Exclusion Lock with the same basic behavior and semantics
as the implicit monitor lock accessed using synchronized methods and statements,
but with extended capabilities.
```

[In JVM, Why use a ReentrantLock if one can use synchronized(x)?](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11821900/432903)

```
A ReEntrantLock is unstructured, unlike synchronized constructs -- 
i.e. you don't need to use a block structure for locking and can even hold a lock across methods

2. Semaphore
------------

```
A semaphore, on the other hand, has a count and can be locked by that many lockers concurrently. 
And it may not have a requirement that it be released by the same thread that claimed it 
(but, if not, you have to carefully track who currently has responsibility for it, much like allocated memory).

So, if you have a number of instances of a resource (say three tape drives), you could use a semaphore 
with a count of 3. Note that this doesn't tell you which of those tape drives you have, 
just that you have a certain number.

Also with semaphores, it's possible for a single locker to lock multiple instances of a resource, 
such as for a tape-to-tape copy. If you have one resource (say a memory location that you don't want to corrupt), 
a mutex is more suitable.
```

- A typical example would be a pool of database connections that can be handed out to requesting threads. 
Say there are ten available connections but 50 requesting threads. 
In such a scenario, a semaphore can only give out ten permits or connections at any given point in time.
- it can also be used for cooperation and signaling amongst threads. 
Semaphore also solves the issue of missed signals.

- Mutex is owned by a thread, whereas a semaphore has no concept of ownership.

3. monitor
----------

- a `monitor` is made up of a mutex and one or more condition variables
- `monitor` has two queues or sets where threads can be placed. One is the "entry set" and the other is the "wait set"
- Practically, in Java each object is a monitor and implicitly has a lock and is a condition variable too. 
- You can think of a monitor as a mutex with a wait set. 
- Monitors allow threads to exercise mutual exclusion as well as cooperation by allowing them to wait and signal 
on conditions.

- Hoare monitors - the signaling thread B yields the monitor to the woken up thread A and 
"thread A" enters the monitor, while "thread B" sits out. 
- The Java language and runtime system support thread synchronization through the use of monitors

- A semaphore can allow several threads access to a given resource or critical section, 
however, only a single thread at any point in time can own the monitor and access associated resource.
